      <description>This project has three components, giving an account of the truthmakers, the truthbearers, and the relationship between them.

      <title>Truthmaker Semantics</title>
      <link>https://markjago.github.io/markjago/research/truthmakersemantics/</link>

      <guid>https://markjago.github.io/markjago/research/truthmakersemantics/</guid>
      <description>Truthmaker Semantics is a new philosophical approach to questions about meaning, with applications in logic and philosophy of language.
Truthmaker semantics has roots in the situation semantics of Barwise and Perry and, going back further, in the logical atomism of Russell and Wittgenstein.</description>
