      <description>We need to understand the impossible. Francesco Berto and Mark Jago start by considering what the concepts of meaning, information, knowledge, belief, fiction, conditionality, and counterfactual supposition have in common.</description>

      <title>What Truth Is</title>
      <link>http://markjago.net/books/3-whattruthis/</link>

      <guid>http://markjago.net/books/3-whattruthis/</guid>
      <description>I present and defend a novel theory of what truth is, in terms of the metaphysical notion of truthmaking. This is the relation which holds between a truth and some entity in the world, in virtue of which that truth is true.</description>

      <description>Islamophiobia, antisemitism, and other forms of discrimination against religious minorities are a stain on society and they&amp;rsquo;re on the rise. Religious minorities need special protection in law and in social conduct generally.</description>

      <description>The latter half of the 20th Century witnessed an ‘intensional revolution’: a great collective effort to analyse notions which are absolutely fundamental to our understanding of the world and of ourselves in terms of a single concept.</description>

      <description>This project has three components, giving an account of the truthmakers, the truthbearers, and the relationship between them.
As part of this research, I developed an account of (non-linguistic) facts, including negative, conjunctive and existential facts.</description>

      <title>Truthmaker Semantics</title>
      <link>http://markjago.net/research/truthmakersemantics/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://markjago.net/research/truthmakersemantics/</guid>
      <description>Truthmaker Semantics is a new philosophical approach to questions about meaning, with applications in logic and philosophy of language.
Truthmaker semantics has roots in the situation semantics of Barwise and Perry and, going back further, in the logical atomism of Russell and Wittgenstein.</description>
